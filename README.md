# Cricket-data-analysis
In this project I have worked with cricket dataset and do some analysis. This cricket data set is batting data set of ODI matches.

First of all I got the raw data in which I did data Pre-Processing so that data can be normalized in way such that meaningful information can be derived, then with the 
help of matplolib i used to create some plots like histogram, bar chart, distplot, line chart, heat map etc.
Also in this project i worked with pandas and numpy libraries for data analysis.

with the use of above defined libraries I have created some question and tried to solve that question by data analysis.
